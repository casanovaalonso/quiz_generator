    "The first part of the assessment is to create the Quiz Question Generator service itself.\n",
    "For this task, you will have at your disposal the OpenAI API with a maximum budget of 50$ (saving\n",
    "costs is a plus):\n",
    "1. OpenAI API Key is provided in a separate text file\n",
    "2. The questions are multiple-choice with 4 answers to choose from. One, and only one, of the\n",
    "answers has to be the correct answer.\n",
    "3. The input should be a single learning objective. For example: “Balance chemical equations\n",
    "using the law of conservation of mass”\n",
    "4. The output has to be properly formatted in a human-readable form.\n",
    "5. The questions must be suited to students in higher education and expressed in English.\n",
    "6. The generator has to provide an API.\n",
